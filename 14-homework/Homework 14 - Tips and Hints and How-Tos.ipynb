    "There are a lot of sections in here, so be sure to browse around - pandas, matplotlib, Illustrator, and some specifically for items in the homeowrk.\n",
    "\n",
    "# General pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the full import statement? You'll want: pandas, matplotlib, pyplot, and you'll want to make sure graphs are going to be displayed in your notebook. And that fonts are going to save right in PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading in files\n",
    "\n",
    "When files are in a subdirectory, you can't just say `pd.read_csv(\"filename.csv\")` - you need to say \"oh you're in a subdirectory, let me go in there, too.\" Usually something like `pdf.read_csv(\"my_folder/filename.csv\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to check your data types! Numbers should be ints or floats, dates should be datetimes (although usually it's okay for years to not be). You convert between most with `.astype`, but for dates you need to do something like `df['new_columns'] = pd.to_dataframe(df['date_columns'], format=\"....\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fixing things up\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it's easier to do things in pandas/matplotlib, sometimes it's easier to do in Illustrator. As a general rule, sorting, grids, and sizing are all easier in pandas and annotations are easier in Illustrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combining datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine datasets in pandas, you use `.merge`. In a perfect world, you'd do this to combine two dataframes named df1 and df2:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df1.merge(df2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "to merge the LEFT dataset (df1) with the RIGHT dataset (df2). Unfortuantely this is always impossible, because it requires your datasets to have column names in common so it can guess how to join them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, you need to tell it two things: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `left_on`, the name of the join column for the first dataframe\n",
    "* `right_on`, the name of the join column for the second dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will usually be something like, \"I want to join `city` in df1 with `municipality_name` in df2,\" in which case you'd run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df1.merge(df2, left_on='city', right_on='municipality_name')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks cool, but you also need to save your new merged dataframe somewhere. Your end result will probably look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "merged = df1.merge(df2, left_on='city', right_on='municipality_name')\n",
    "merged.head()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reversing\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually you can use `.sort_values()` to sort things, but every now and again you just want it to go in reverse. You can use `ascending=False` or you can lose your mind and do something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.iloc[::-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Scary, right? You can also do it on a single column, `df['Name'].iloc[::-1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Graphing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Saving graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you're always doing the same imports up top!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "import matplotlib\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "matplotlib.rcParams['pdf.fonttype'] = 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially that last one, so when you save your PDFs they'll have editable text. You can save using this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.savefig(\"output.pdf\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It will only work if it's in the **same cell** as where you're graphing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple and stacked bar charts\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal bar chart is just a bar for every row. But sometimes you want TWO bars for every row!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we had a coffee shop, and every row was a month. If we had a `tea` column, we could plot tea sales like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.plot(kind='bar', x='month', y='tea')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we also had a `coffee` column, though, we could also make a grouped bar chart, where each month gets a bar for tea AND a bar for coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.plot(kind='bar', x='month', y=['tea', 'coffee'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were interested in the total between tea and coffee, we could also stack the tea and coffee on top of each other by adding `stacked=True`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.plot(kind='bar', x='month', y=['tea', 'coffee'], stacked=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want something stacked out of 100% but your columns don't add up to 100%. In that case, do math.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Putting multiple graphs on the same chart\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have two separate plots you want to put on top of each other, you can do it two different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You can just save them separately and cut and paste in Illustrator to stack them on top of each other. This way sucks.\n",
    "2) You know how we made a plot and saved it to `ax` and then did like `ax.set_ylim(...)` and `ax.set_title(...)` and stuff? You can make a blank `ax`, and then keep telling graphs to go on top of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this will create a separate plot for each continent:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.groupby('Continent').plot(x='GDP_per_capita', y='life_expectancy', marker='.', linestyle='')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's kind of like a for loop, making a new plot for each group. Instead, we need to create a blank graph, and then say \"hey `.plot`, use this graph!!!\" We do that like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",
    "\n",
    "df.groupby('Continent').plot(ax=ax, x='GDP_per_capita', y='life_expectancy', marker='.', linestyle='')```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first line, `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` we are building a blank canvas. Why does the code look like that? I don't know, because we aren't allowed to have nice things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then each time we want to draw a chart, we pass `ax=ax` to `.plot` to tell it where to draw instead of making a totally new graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes this works when you're stacking separate graphs on top of each other, too (like layering), but sometimes it doesn't. I'd like to explain more but it seriously changes every 6 months and I have no idea where we're at right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Highlighting points/categories/etc\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of ways to do this!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Building colors to pass to matplotlib or Seaborn\n",
    "# Use as color=colors for matplotlib, palette=colors for Seaborn\n",
    "def build_colors(row):\n",
    "    if row['Country'] == 'Switzerland':\n",
    "        return 'red'\n",
    "    elif row['Country'] == 'Germany':\n",
    "        return 'red'\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return 'lightgrey'\n",
    "\n",
    "colors = df.reset_index().apply(build_colors, axis=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And then you use it by passing `color=` to your `.plot` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.plot(x='Country', y='life_expectancy', color=colors)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Line graphs (and other types)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a line graph, `style='-'`. If you want dots, `style='.'`. If you want lines AND dots, you want `style='.-'`. Why can't it all just be `kind='bar'` and `kind='scatter'` and `kind='line'` and `kind='line-with-dots'`? I don't know, life sucks.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also look at https://matplotlib.org/api/markers_api.html - instead of `.` you can use `o` or `v` or a million other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coloring your dots and such\n",
    "\n",
    "* `color='red'` to make everything red\n",
    "* `markeredgecolor='black'` to make the edges black\n",
    "* `markerfacecolor='blue'` to make the fill color blue (why is it called face color and not fill color????)\n",
    "* `markersize=10` or `size=10` to make the circles 10 pixels (depending on the kind of graph you're making)\n",
    " \n",
    "If you want them to not have a marker color or edge color of whatever disappear, make the color `'none'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Size of the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "`figsize=(10, 20)` when you're graphing, or when you're doing `plot.subplots` if you're doing the `ax=ax` trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grid Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "To add/remove/adjust grid lines, follow this guide: http://jonathansoma.com/lede/data-studio/matplotlib/adding-grid-lines-to-a-matplotlib-chart/\n",
    "\n",
    "Or just note you can do things like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ax.grid('on', axis='y', which='major', linestyle='-', linewidth='0.5', color='red')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To turn on the grid for a specific part of an axis and give it a specific style/color.\n",
    "\n",
    "`linestyle` can be `:` or `-` or `--` or `-.` - read here if you don't believe me: https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/line_styles_reference.html. You can also change the dashes in Illustrator, which might be easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"WHAT DOES 'major' MEAN???\" - read the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tick Marks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of tick marks on an axis. MINOR and MAJOR. MAJOR get labels. MINOR do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "When setting tick marks on the x or y axis, you can use `.set_xticks` and `.set_yticks` to make tick mark labels appear in specific places. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ax.set_xticks([2005, 2006, 2007, 2008])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But!!! The above doesn't work if your data is actual dates, only if it's integers. If you try to do the above with a datetime, you'll get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, you need to reach in and adjust the MAJOR ticks (because you want labels). If you wanted to make there be a tick mark WITH A LABEL every single month, it would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.dates as dates\n",
    "ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(dates.MonthLocator())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you also wanted there to be a tick mark WITHOUT a label (minor) every 5 days, it would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(dates.DayLocator(interval=5))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rotating tick marks\n",
    "\n",
    "`rot=0`, `rot=90`, etc when using `plot`, OR select them all in Illustrator (hold down SHIFT when clicking them, or just draw a box that touches them all), `Object > Transform > Transform Each`, check 'Preview', and then play around with 'Angle'\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding an extra axis\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you just want more labels! Let's say you graphed something very long where you had everyone's name on the left-hand side but also wanted it on the right-hand side. You'd build your graph, save it as `ax`, then use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Duplicate the graph, giving it the same x axis\n",
    "alt = ax.twinx()\n",
    "# Set the new graph to have its tick marks in the same position\n",
    "alt.set_yticks(ax.yaxis.get_ticklocs()) \n",
    "alt.set_ylim(ax.get_ylim())\n",
    "# Set the labels for the tick marks to be the same, too\n",
    "alt.set_yticklabels(df['Name'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does it work? Who knows. But be careful, you might need to sort/reverse to make the labels correct.\n",
    "\n",

    "Before you do _ANYTHING_ you should remove clipping masks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select everything (Command+A)\n",
    "2. `Object > Clipping Mask > Release` (Command + Option + 7)\n",

    "## Lining up things\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have multiple things selected, the `Align` bar becomes active at the top. You can... align things with other things using it instead of manually pushing things around. You might want to play around with the different \"Align to...\" options.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/align.png)\n",

    "## Making donut charts\n",
    "\n",
    "Donut charts are just pies missing the center. So if you make a pie and just _draw a big white circle in the middle_, it suddenly becomes a donut.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making pie charts\n",
    "\n",
    "if `kind='scatter'` makes a scatter and `kind='bar'` makes a bar, how do you think you make a pie? Well, [`kind='pie'`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html#pie-plot)!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pass `labels=` to the pie chart maker it'll label your data. Try passing `labels='region'` and see the totally-wrong-but-kind-of-funny thing that happens. Then fix it! (or ask me about it).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Building them in the same matplotlib graph**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, select _only_ the columns you want to make the pie from. You can do this two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the super-weird `df[['col1','col2']]` style multiple-column selection\n",
    "2. You could also use `df.drop('col3', axis=1)` (without `inplace=True`, you don't want it to last forever!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Try that in a cell by itself to make sure you've gotten rid of `region`. Once it looks okay, put a `.plot` right after that and tell it to make a pie, but with `subplots=True`.\n",

    "## The Economist arrow chart??\n",
    "\n",
    "We aren't making an arrow chart, it's ugly. We're doing another kind of chart!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part One: The lines\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't work with pandas, so we're going to be talking right to matplotlib. We're going to use something called `ax.hlines`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how `hlines` works, try this out:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",
    "ax.hlines(xmin=[1, 2, 3, 4], xmax=[7, 8, 9, 20], y=[1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The lines start from `xmin` and go to `xmax`. First xmin + first xmax + first y, second xmin + second xmax + second y, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by adapting the code above to build the chart below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/dotlines-0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the y axis is _obviously_ the region, it won't let you do it! It wants numbers! So we'll cheat and use `df.index`, which is the `0, 1, 2...` thing on the left-hand side.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part Two: The dots\n",
    "\n",
    "`ax.scatter` is going to be your new friend. It takes an `x` and a `y`, and you'll use it to add little nubs for the 2011 profits. Remember, since it's `ax.scatter` we're talking directly to matplotlib and we can't just use column names, we have to give it the `df`, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/dotlines-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part Three: The labels\n",
    "\n",
    "Just copy and paste this part! First we're saying \"put the y ticks at these numbers\" then we're saying \"oh wait use these words instead.\" Why do we need both? I don't know, programming.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Part Four: Your options from here\n",
    "\n",
    "You're picking the style, right? So do whatever you want!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You could also do a dot for 2007, just in a different color. It would also use `ax.scatter`.\n",
    "2. If you really wanted to do arrows you could, get rid of the dots and use the 'Arrowheads' part of the 'Stroke' menu in Illustrator\n",
    "3. Would any annotations or grids be useful here? What are you trying to stress?\n",
    "4. How do you feel about the size of the dots and the lines?\n",
    "5. You probably wanted to sort it (especially since I told you to). If you use `.sort_valeus` it actually won't work because we keep using the index in a kind of unusual way (the left-hand-side number, the index, gets out of order). So after you sort, try `.reset_index(drop=True)`. Save that back into your `df` to update it forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Colors won't change from grey\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up the colors menu, click the thing in the upper right-hand corner, and select 'RGB' instead of 'Greyscale\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bar plots with multiple things going on\n",
    "\n",
    "You can give multiple `y` values, like `y=['col1','col2']` if you want to have a grouped bar plot. You add `stacked=True` if you want them stacked on top of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Invisible grids\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes instead of having a grid you can see, you only see the grid lines when it intersects with your data. I'd probably graph the grid in an ugly color, then select them and `Object > Arrange > Move to Front`, then make it white.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More arrow tips for The Guardian one\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, maybe we didn't like the arrow chart before, but I guess we're doing one now. Make it similarly to how you make the one for the Economist.\n",
    "\n",
    "It sure seems like all of the arrows are coming from one place. Maybe `hlines` is fine with that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Make the arrowheads in Illustrator. `Window > Stroke` to open the stroke menu, then click the upper right-hand corner to make sure **Show Options** is turned on. Then you can play with the **Arrowheads** options.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for the Guardian commuting one\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a _lot_ of ways to do all of this bits and pieces for this one! If you have a thought and want to talk through it before you start feel free to chat me up in Slack.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, did you know Illustrator has a graph tool?\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/illustrator-graph.png)\n",
    "\n",

You're never gonna get it on and be someone stuck in that crowd

But don't be ashamed of your bones and your blisters
So come on, come on my brothers and sisters
'Coz you can only be what you are and you've got
The heart of a star but the light never hits ya

If you could see what I could see, maybe we could all get along

So, I call out the feelin' I know that don't never exist
I won't be ashamed of my bones and my blisters
So come on, come on my brothers and sisters
'Coz you can only be what you are 'coz you've got
The heart of a star but the light never hits ya
And I said come on, come on my brothers and sisters
And the slower that you go, the greener the grass grows
And what we all need is love in our lives
So go about you business 'cos life ain't your mistress
Come on, come on my brothers and sisters
'Coz you can only be what you are 'coz you've got
The heart of a star but the light never hits ya
So be all you can and just hold up your hands
Someday you'll understand why life never kissed you
And I said come on, come on my brothers and sisters
Come on, come on my brothers and sisters
I said come on, come on my brothers and sisters
I said come on, come on my brothers and sisters
I said come on, come on my brothers and sisters"

I've been there once before
You pulled me through my empty nights
Sleepless on your floor
The sun will shine on you again
A bell will ring inside your head

What's sleepin' in our soul
Because we need each other
We believe in one another

I know that if I hear you

You only stand still

Maybe your time is coming
Will you ask to climb when you find the wall
Is it time to doubt?
Is it time to wait?
Will you be left alone at the starting gate
I'm not blind
And I don't mind
Coz I've got time
now I'm alive
The people have noticed that the times are changing
But are they gonna be something now
I think I've seen you all hesitating
I think I'll go and be something now
You want something for nothing

I would only crush it's tender petals
With me you'll have no escape
And at the same time there'll be nowhere to settle
I trample down all life in my wake
I eat it up and take the cake
I just avert my eyes to the pain
Of someone's loss helping my gain
If you gave me a dream for my pocket
You'd be plugging in the wrong socket
With me there's no room for the future
With me there's no room with a view at all
I am out of season all year around
Hear machinery roar to my empty sound
Touch my heart and feel winter
Hold my hand and be doomed forever
If you gave me a fresh carnation
I would only crush it's tender petals
With me you'll have no escape
And at the same time there'll be nowhere to settle
And if you're wondering by now who I am
Look no further than the mirror
Cause I am the greed and fear
And every ounce of hate in you"

I feel like a Bona Fide
Keeper of the right and wrong
And I've known all along, so let me just make it clear
Everybody's gone for quick, sure fire solution
But faith in any god will only bury us all
No-one's gonna fight in a ten-bob revolution
Have faith in what you've got and it will carry us all
Carry us all
I slip my skin as the prophets reappear
But I pay no mind
I'm just trying to persevere
With the sins I have to shake from me within
Though I might beware
'Cos they're just trying to wear me thin
They got me running in and out of time
I feel like a Bona Fide
Keeper of the right and wrong
And I've known all along, but let me just make it clear
Everybody's gone for quick, sure fire solution
But faith in any god is gonna bury us all
No-one's gonna fight in a ten-bob revolution
Have faith in what we've got is gonna carry us all
Carry us all
Everybody's gone for quick, sure fire solution
But faith in any god is gonna bury us all
No-one's gonna fight in a ten-bob revolution
Have faith in what you've got and it will carry us all
Carry us all
Carry us all"
Cast No Shadow,1995,http://www.metrolyrics.com/cast-no-shadow-lyrics-oasis.html,2,"Here's a thought for every man who tries to understand
What is in his hands (What is in his hands)
He walks along the open road of love and life
Survivin' if he can (Survivin' if he can)
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
Chained to all the places that he never wished to stay
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
As he face the sun he cast no shadow
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As he face the sun he cast no shadow

How many lives are living strange?
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall

Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova
A Champagne Supernova in the sky
Wake up the dawn and ask her why?
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova in the sky
Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a Champagne Supernova
A Champagne Supernova
'Cos people believe that they're
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning round
We don't know why?
Why? Why? Why? Why?

How many lives are living strange?

Is taking me over
The wind that brings on the rain
Is making me older
Downtown the moon is shining
I'm gonna dress it up in style
My business everybody's minding

Since I was a kid
You're bringing back those memories
Of the things that we did
You're hangin round
And climbing trees
Pretending to fly
D'yer wanna be a spaceman
And live in the sky
You got how many bills to pay
And how many kids
And you forgot about
The things that we did
The town where we're living
Has made you a man
And all of your dreams
Are washed in the sand
Well it's alright
It's alright
Who are you and me to say
What's wrong and what's right
Do you still feel like me
We sit down here
And we shall see
We can talk
And find common ground
And we can just forget
About feeling down
We can just forget
About life in this town.
It's funny how your dreams
Change as you're growing old
You don't wanna be no spaceman
You just want gold
All the dream stealers
Are lying in wait
But if you wanna be a spaceman
It's still not too late
Well it's alright
And it's alright
Who are you and me to say
What's wrong and what's right
Do you still feel like me
We sit down here
And we shall see
We can talk
And find common ground
And we can just forget
About feeling down
We can just forget
About life in this town."

Dream it while you can
Maybe someday I'll make you understand
I'll paint you the picture

Fade In-Out,2006,http://www.metrolyrics.com/fade-inout-lyrics-oasis.html,3,"Get on the rollercoaster
The fair's in town today
Y'gotta be bad-enough to beat the brave
So get on the helter skelter
Bowl into the fray
Y'gotta be bad-enough to beat the brave
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
Without a doubt
I don't see no shine
Today is just a daydream
Tomorrow we'll be castaway
Coming in-out of nowhere
Singin' rhapsody
Y'gotta be bad-enough to wanna be
Sitting upside a high chair
With the devils refugee
Is gonna be blinded by the light
That follows me
She fade in-out
She fade in-out
Without a doubt
I don't see no shine
Today is just a daydream
Tomorrow she'll be castaway

Falling Down,2008,http://www.metrolyrics.com/falling-down-lyrics-oasis.html,3,"Summer sun that blows my mind
Is falling down on all that I've ever known
Time will kiss the world goodbye
Falling down on all that I've ever known
Is all that I've ever known
A dying scream makes no sound
Calling out to all that I've ever known
Here am I, lost and found
Calling out to all
We live a dying dream
If you know what I mean
And all that I've ever known
It's all that I've ever known
Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly
I cried the rain that fills the ocean wide
I tried to talk with God to no avail
Called him up in-and-out of nowhere
Said ""if you won't save me, please, don't waste my time""
Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly
I cried the rain that fills the ocean wide
I tried to talk with God to no avail
Called him up in-and-out of nowhere
Said ""if you won't save me, please, don't waste my time""
Summer sun that blows my mind
Is falling down on all that I've ever known
In time we'll kiss the world goodbye
Falling down on all that I've ever known
Is all that I've ever known"

I can say what I wanna
Feel how I wanna feel now
I can squeeze all the hours
I choose to devour with ease now
I can sing to the trees
Tarzan on harmonies for free, yeah
You've been blocked and you're storming
Nature is calling for me, you got me
Yeah, I've been hung in a bad place
Had no sun on my face
I've been hung in a bad place

I Am The Walrus,2006,http://www.metrolyrics.com/i-am-the-walrus-lyrics-oasis.html,0,"I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying
Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation T-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob
Mister City Policeman sitting, pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying
Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain
'Cause I am the egg man, we are the egg men
And I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob
Experts, experts choking smokers
Don't you thing the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide, I'm crying
Semolina Pilchard, climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hari Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe
I am the egg man, we are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...

Or would you hide behind them all?

In my heart you'd grow
And that's where you belon

If I'm to fall

You lay me down gently on the leaves
you cover me over in my sleep
I never did say and I wish I could
I never could pray 'cos it's just no good
I hope you don't break up my heart of stone
I don't wanna scream out loud
And wake up on my own
And as i close my eyes
And the sky turns red

Or just getting older?
And I bet that this is how life
Turns out when you're finally grown
And you know if this my life
Sit around all day and I moan
I'm halfway up to the bottom
Of another bottle
Of my next best favourite friend
Am I cracking up
Or just getting older?
You're not cracking up
You're just getting older
We're not cracking up
We're just getting older"
Keep The Dream Alive,2005,http://www.metrolyrics.com/keep-the-dream-alive-lyrics-oasis.html,1,"Four seasons, seconds, flicker, flash I'm alone
A lonely screen provides the scene, it's no home
Every night I hear you scream
But you don't say what you mean
this was my dream but now my dream has flown
Im at the crossroads waiting for a sign
My life is standing still but I'm still alive
Every night I think I know
in the morning where did he go
The answers disappear when I open my eyes
I'm no stranger to this place
Where real life and dreams collide
and even though i fall from grace
I will keep the dream alive
I will keep the dream alive
Four seasons, seconds, flicker, flash I'm alone
A lonely screen provides the scene, it's no home
Every night I hear you scream
But you don't say what you mean
this was my dream but now my dream has flown
I'm no stranger to this place
Where real life and dreams collide
and even though i fall from grace
I will keep the dream alive
I will keep the dream alive(x2)

So the heavens would cry over me?
Who stole the soul from the sun
In a world come undone at the seams?
Let there be love
Let there be love
I hope the weather is calm
As you sail up your heavenly stream
Suspended clear in the sky
Are the words that we sing in our dreams
Let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love
Come on, baby blue
Shake up your tired eyes
The world is waiting for you
May all your dreaming fill the empty sky
But if it makes you happy
Keep on clapping
Just remember I'll be by your side
And if you don't let go, it's gonna pass you by
Who kicked a hole in the sky
So the heavens would cry over me?
Who stole the soul from the sun
In a world come undone at the seams?

Just what they mean or is it too late?
For anyone here to try to do
Just what it takes to get through to you

Strangle my hope and make me pray
To a god I've never seen but who I betray
To the people who live the afterlife
And the place I'll never be 'til I'm crucified

We're still friends and we like each other

Little By Little,2007,http://www.metrolyrics.com/little-by-little-lyrics-oasis.html,5,"We the people fight for our existence
We don't claim to be perfect
But we're free
We dream our dreams alone
With no resistance
Fading like the stars we wish to be
You know I didn't mean
What I just said
But my God woke up
On the wrong side of his bed
And it just don't matter now
Cos little by little
We gave you everything
You ever dreamed of
Little by little
The wheels of your life
Have slowly fallen off
Little by little
You have to give it all in all your life
And all the time I just ask myself why
You're really here
True perfection has to be imperfect
I know that that sounds foolish but it's true
The day has come
And now you'll have to accept
The life inside your head we give to you
You know I didn't mean
What I just said
But my God woke up
On the wrong side of his bed
And it just don't matter now
Cos little by little
We gave you everything
You ever dreamed of
Little by little
The wheels of your life
Have slowly fallen off
Little by little
You have to give it all in all your life
And all the time I just ask myself why

Even tried a trampoline

For you and your mom
And that's all

Before everyone is gone
Sailed out to sea
Your mom, you and me
You swam the oceans like a child
Life around us was so wild

They are sleeping while they dream, but then they want to be adored,
They who don't say what they mean,
Will live and die by their own sword.

I dig their shoes,
But they are like a child with nothing to lose,
But their minds, yeah their minds.
I'll have my way,
In my own time,
I'll have my say,
My star will shine.

I've got my Magic Pie.
Think of me, yeah that was me
I was that passer by,
I've been and now I've gone.
There are but a thousand days but heading for a thousand years,
Many minds to educate, and people who have disappeared,
To dig my friends, to dig my shoes,
I am like a child with nothing to lose,
But my mind, yeah my mind,
We'll have our way,
In our own time,
We'll have our say,

It's the time that every centre has a ball
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer?
Do a 'ton up' on a sleigh
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?

Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
Are you waiting for your family to arrive?
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell ya that the old songs are the best?
She'll be up and rock 'n' rollin' with the rest
So here it is merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
What will your daddy do
If he sees ure mama kissin' Santa claus?
Ah ah
Are you hanging up your stockings on a wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you ride on down the hillside in a buggy you have made?
When you land upon your ass then you've been slayed

An explanation on the meanings of life
But what you think that you heard
Slipped away out the back of your mind
You'll get your mucky fingers burned
You'll get your truth from the lies you were learned
When all your plastic believers will leave us
They won't return
And when you look in that mirror
And you're tying up your buttons and bows
And as you face your disease
You can squeeze into the emperor's clothes
You found your God in a paperback
You get your history from the Union Jack
And all your brothers and sisters have gone
And they won't come back
I'm fed up with life in the city
All the phonies have blown my mind
When I'm gone, you look like you'd miss me
So, come along with me, but don't ask why
'Cause it's all mine
It's all mine
It's all mine
It's all mine
It's all mine

Watch my style, pick a place
Wipe the smile from your face
I don't feel to unveil

All I want is the truth"
One Way Road,2006,http://www.metrolyrics.com/one-way-road-lyrics-oasis.html,0,"I wanna get high, but I never could take the pain
'cos it would blow away my soul like a hurricane

If I know where I'm going, I don't know from where I came
Where we gonna be in summertime?
And are we gonna see the heavens shine
Like diamonds in the sky?
As soon as they come
The feelings they go
All alone, on a one way road
As soon as they come
The feelings they go
All alone, on a one way road
I wanna get high, but I really can't take the pain

Part Of The Queue,2005,http://www.metrolyrics.com/part-of-the-queue-lyrics-oasis.html,2,"Suddenly I found
That I'd lost my way in this city
The streets and the thousands of colors
All bleed into one
I fall down, Heaven won't help me
I call out, no one would hear
All of a sudden
I'd lost my way out of the city
Stand tall, stand proud
Every beginning
Is breaking its promise
I'm having trouble
Just finding my soul in this town
The names on the faces in places
They mean nothing to me
It's all they can do
To be part of the queue in this town
I fall down, Heaven won't help me
I call out, no one will hear
Be no tomorrow they say
Well, I say more's the pity
Stand tall, stand proud
Every beginning
Is breaking its promise
I'm having trouble
Just finding my soul in this town
Stand tall, stand proud
Every beginning
Is breaking its promise
I'm having trouble
Just finding my soul in this town
Finding my soul in this town

its getting near that time
What you got tomorrow?
Only pain and sorrow
Will you dance for me tonight
I promise I wont bite
Lets go and see the sun burst
Wait till i go NUMB first
And in the morning come to us
And if the evening showers us
Sing to Us
Will you break it down for me
Coz what will be will be
I can hear the thunder
Gonna stop the hunger
And in the morning come to us
And if the evening showers us
Sing to Us
To all my sisters
Yeh you're looking really fine
Yo all my brothers
Bet you're feeling kinda high
To all the mothers
Well come on now don't be shy
To all the fathers
Who are sick and f**king tired

Lying to the teacher he knows he knows
He didn't and he should've
Brought his lines in yesterday
Ernie bangs the sound and the day begins
The letterbox is open and your cash falls in
I'll meet you at the office
Just before the staff clock in
Round are way the birds are singing
Round are way the sun shines bright
Round are way the birds sing for yer
The already know yer
The game is kicking off in around the park
It's twenty five a side and before it's dark
There's gonna be a loser
And you know the next goal wins
Cab it to the front as it's called a draw
Everybody's knockin at yours once more
Ernie bangs the sound
And no one's spoken since half past four
Round are way the birds are singing
Round are way the sun shines bright
Round are way the birds are minging
Round are way it's alright
Round are way the birds sing for you

In a lonely place
Try to put a word in for me
It's been so long
Since I found a space
You better put in two or three
We as people, are just walking 'round
Our heads are firmly fixed in the ground
What we don't see
Well it can't be real
What we don't touch we cannot feel
Where we're living, in this town
The sun is coming up and it's going down
But it's all, just the same at the end of the day
And we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong
So we don't ask why
Cause it's all, just the same at the end of the day
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away at the end of the day
If you're needing
Something I can give
I know I'd help you if I can
If you're honest, and you say that you did
You know that I would give you my hand
Or a sad song
In a lonely place
I'll try to put a word in for you
Need a shoulder? Well if that's the case
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do
Where we're living, in this town
The sun is coming up and it's going down
But it's all, just the same at the end of the day
And we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong
So we don't ask why
Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away

Scorpio Rising,2007,http://www.metrolyrics.com/scorpio-rising-lyrics-oasis.html,2,"When you kiss the base o'my spine
Make my body into your shrine
You give me this feeling deep inside
One that I can no longer disguise
While other snakes just shed their skins
Forked tongues pointing out my sins
Even though I realise that history's not on my side
Even though I realise the pioneer skin still curls up in my eyes
If I don't go crazy, I'll lose my mind
I saw a life before me but now I'm blind
I wanna go to heaven, never been there before
I wanna go to heaven, so you kill me some more
Flying high upon the gallows
Too messed up to step out of the shadows
A drugged up heart that knows no sorrow
Rescued from this deep dark hollow
Stick on these boots and sharpen the nails
Time is nigh for you leather girls
Maybe we should end this race
Vanish while we cannot leave no trace
If I don't go crazy, I'll lose my mind
I saw a life before me, but now I'm blind
See one-arm film stars on alien beaches
Potted gold and tattooed faces
Harrison murals on the corner, tupperware boxes full of hops
Diazepam dreams there catching streams
Paper dinosaurs flash blue and green
Still I've got a flash-bulb head
Still I've got a flash-bulb head
If I don't go crazy, I'll lose my mind
I saw a life before me but now I'm blind
I wanna go to heaven, never been there before
I wanna go to heaven, so you kill me some more
Come along nice, come along dead
Scorpio rising, and paint it red
A psychic equalizer in your head
Come along nice, come along dead
Scorpio rising, and paint it red
A psychic equalizer in your head.."

Solve My Mystery,2006,http://www.metrolyrics.com/solve-my-mystery-lyrics-oasis.html,1,"They took my faith

They told me I lost my mind but
I believe that I rule the world
I'm singing out my revolution song
Like nothing else matters
And you can pitch your gold against my soul
But I bet you get shattered
And there's a million houses in my heart
It won't be long
It won't be long
Till I solve my mystery
It would for me
What do I believe in and
A masterkey
Is somewhere inside of the world in which I live
And what for they
They will speak for no-one
And I may have lost my mind
But I believe that I rule my world
I'm singing out my revolution song
Like nothing else matters
You can pitch your gold against my soul
But I bet you get shattered
And there's a million houses in my heart
It won't be long
It won't be long
Till I solve my mystery
And I'm singing out my revolution song
Like nothing else matters
And you can pitch your gold against my soul
But you gotta get shattered
And there's a million houses in my heart
And it won't be long
It won't be long
Till I solve my mystery
Till I solve my mystery"
Some Might Say,1995,http://www.metrolyrics.com/some-might-say-lyrics-oasis.html,5,"Some might say that sunshine follows thunder
Go and tell it to the man who cannot shine
Some might say that we should never ponder
On our thoughts today 'cause they hold away over time
Some might say we will find a brighter day
some might say we will find a brighter day (Yeah)
'Cause I've been standing at the station
in need of education in the rain
You made no preparation
for my reputation once again
The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
it was overflowing gently
But it's all elementary my friend
. . .
Some might say they don't believe in heaven
Go and tell it to the man who lives in hell
Some might say you get what you've been given
If you don't get yours I won't get mine as well
Some might say we will find a brighter day
some might say we will find a brighter day (Yeah)
'Cause I've been standing at the station
in need of education in the rain
That made no preparation
for my reputation once again
The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
And my dog's been itching
Itching in the kitchen once again
Some might say (some might say)

I've got a lot of things to learn
Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
Before my heart starts to burn
So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new... Don't you know
The cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away
Times are hard when things have got no meaning
I've found a key upon the floor
Maybe you and I will not believe in the things we find behind the door
So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new... Don't you know
The cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away
Stand by me (nobody knows the way it's gonna be)
Stand by me (nobody knows the way it's gonna be)
Stand by me (nobody knows the way it's gonna be)
Stand by me (nobody knows, yeah, nobody knows the way it's gonna be)
If you're leaving will you take me with you
I'm tired of talking on my phone
There is one thing I can never give you
My heart will never be your home
So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new... Don't you know
The cold and wind and rain don't know

she needs to lighten her load

think you're gonna cry
it will be all right
step out tonight
You might
think you're gonna cry
it will be all right

Lost inside my head behind a wall

But what for
And in your head do you feel
What you're not supposed to feel
And you take what you want
But you don't get it for free
You need more time
'Cause your thoughts and words won't last forever more
And I'm not sure
If it'll ever work out right
But it's okay
It's all right
When you're lonely and you start to hear
The little voices in your head at night
You will only sniff away the tears
So you can dance until the mornin' light
At what price
And in your head do you feel
What you're not supposed to feel
And you take what you want
But you can't get hope for free
You need more time
Because your thoughts and words won't last forever more
And I'm not sure
If it'll ever ever ever work out right
If it'll ever ever ever work out right
Will it ever ever ever work out right"

How much do you want it

Give me your autograph
Can I ride with you
In your BMW
You can sail with me
In my yellow submarine
You need to find out
'Cause no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you wanna say
But before tomorrow
'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
Sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call
Nobody can ever hear him call
You need to be yourself
You can't be no one else
I know a girl called Elsa
She's into Alka Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane
On a supersonic train
And she makes me laugh
I got her autograph
She done it with a doctor
On a helicopter
She's sniffin in her tissue
Sellin' the Big Issue
When she finds out
No one's gonna tell her what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you wanna say

I landed stranded
Hardly even knew your name

Until the mornin' light
'Bout how you saved my life
You and me see how we are
You and me see how we are
All your dreams are made of strawberry lemonade
And you make sure I eat today
You take me walking
To where you played when you were young
I'll never say that I won't ever make you cry
And this I say I don't know why
I know I'm leaving
But I'll be back another day
I wanna talk tonight
Until the mornin' light

The Importance Of Being Idle,2005,http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-importance-of-being-idle-lyrics-oasis.html,4,"I sold my soul for the second time
Cos the man don't pay me
I begged my landlord for some more time
He said ""Son, the bill's waiting""
My best friend called me the other night
He said ""Man, are you crazy?""
My girlfriend told me to get a life
She said ""boy, you lazy""
But I don't mind
As long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
I'll be fine
If you give me a minute
A mans got a limit
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it
I don't mind
As long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
I'll be fine
If you give me a minute
A man's got a limit
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it
I lost my faith in the summertime
Cos it don't stop raining
The sky all day is as black as night
But I'm not complaining
I begged my doctor for one more line
He said ""Son, words fail me""
It ain't no place to be killing time
I guess I'm just lazy
I don't mind
As long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
I'll be fine
If you give me a minute
A mans got a limit
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it"

Of what you want to say
And cast your words away upon the waves
Sail them home with Acquiesce
On a ship of hope today
And as they land upon the shore
Tell them not to fear no more
Say it loud and sing it proud today...
And then...
Dance if you want to dance
Please brother take a chance
You know they're gonna go
Which way they wanna go
All we know is that we don't know
How it's gonna be
Please brother let it be
Life on the other hand won't make us understand
We're all part of the masterplan
Say it loud
Sing it proud today...
I'm not saying right is wrong
It's up to us to make
The best of all things that come our way
'Cause everything that's been has past
The answer's in the looking glass
There's four and twenty million doors
On life's endless corridor
Say it loud and sing it proud today...
We'll dance if they want to dance
Please brother take a chance
You know they're gonna go
Which way they wanna go
All we know is that we don't know
How it's gonna be
Please brother let it be
Life on the other hand won't let you understand

A magical mystery
And all in good time
And all in good time
And all in good time
I got my feet on the street but I can't stop flying
My head's in the clouds but at least I'm trying
I'm outta control but I'm tied up tight
Come in, come out tonight
There's a hole in the ground into which I'm falling
So godspeed to the sound of the pounding
I'm all into the blinding light
Come in, come out, come in, come out tonight
Love is a time machine
Up on the silver screen
It's all in my mind
Love is a litany
A magical mystery
And all in good time
And all in good time
And all in good time
It's all in my mind
Love is a time machine

All in good time

Rise up from your soul
Hang over the streets at night
Brought on by the cold
We live with the numbers
Mining our dreams for the same old song
What hope for the turning
If everything you know is wrong?
So come on, shake your rag doll, baby
Before you change your mind
Then come on, when the rapture takes me
Be the fallen angel by my side
You carry the lantern
I'll carry you home
You search for the disappeared
I'll bury the cold
Yours is a Messiah
Mine is a dream and it won't be long
No hope for the journey
If no one ever sees the dawn
So come on, shake your rag doll, baby
Before you change your mind
Then come on, when the rapture takes me
Will you be by my side?
Then come on, shake your rag doll, baby
Before you change your mind
Then come on, when the rapture takes me
Be the fallen angel by my side
So come on, shake your rag doll, baby
Before you change your mind
Then come on, when the rapture takes me
Will you be by my side?
Hey, come on, shake your rag doll, baby

Life is like a roller coaster
I can't find the birds or the bees
Hope they're down the back of my sofa
Feeling like a rolling stone
Playing the guitar on my own
I'm the apple of my eye
If only I could keep myself sober i'd remind myself why
They stare at me wherever I go
Why won't everybody give up, no
I wish I learn to play piano
If only I could keep myself sober for more than one day"
To Be Free,2006,http://www.metrolyrics.com/to-be-free-lyrics-oasis.html,1,"Head like a rock spinning round and round
I found it in a hole sitting upside down
You point the finger at me but I don't believe
Paint me a wish on a velvet sky
You demand the answers but I don't know why in my mind
There is no time
But the little things they make me so happy
All I want to do is live by the sea
Little things they make me so happy
But it's good it's good it's good to be free
So what would you say if I said to you
It's not in what you say it's in what you do
You point the finger at me but I don't believe
Bring it on home to where we found
My head like a rock sitting upside down
In my mind there is no time

All I want to do is live by the sea

But it's good it's good it's good to be free"
To Be Someone,2006,http://www.metrolyrics.com/to-be-someone-lyrics-oasis.html,3,"To be someone must be a wonderful thing
A famous footballer a rock singer
Or a big film star, yes I think that I would like
I would like that
To be rich and have a lot of fans
And lots of girls to prove that I'm a man
To be number one - and loved by everyone
Getting drugged up with my trendy friends
They really dig me, man, and I dig them
And the money that I spend, it is like my fame, and it's quickly gone
No more swimming in my guitar shaped pool
No more reporters at my beck and call
No more cocaine, now it's only ground chalk
And I can't afford a taxi so I have to walk
Didn't I have a nice time
Wasn't it sucha nice time
Didn't I have a nice time
I realize I should have stuck to my guns
You stood me out just like a bastard son
And I lost myself, but I know that it was wrong
And it cost me a lot
No more drinking cause now the club shuts down
And I'm out here on my arse with the rest of you clowns
I get really scared without my bodyguard
And I'm sitting all alone in my expensive yard
Didn't I have a nice time
Wasn't it such a nice time
Didn't I have a nice time
Wasn't it such a nice time
I remember it was a nice time
To be someone must be a wonderful thing"

Pray for the light
Let me come through
Let me take you away over the line

Everyone falling
Dreamers come crawling
Neighbours jump walling
Let me come through
Let me take you away over the line

And we're away to be where there's life
Shake the will to comply
Fears don't try me
Tears don't cry me

And we're away to be where there's life
When we come call out
Everything's sold out
TV just closed down
There's nothing on the news now

Fears don't try me
Tears don't cry me
We're away to be where there's life
Be where there's life

Dig out your soul, cos here we go
We gotta move, it's what we do
Let me come through
Let me take you away to be where there's life
To be where there's life

Take you over the light
Under the signs
In through locked doors to secret floors
Where we've lost 'em before"

And float down stream
It is not dying
It is not dying
Lay down all thought
Surrender to the void
It is shining
It is shining
That you may see
The meaning of within
It is being
It is being
That love is all
And love is everyone
It is knowing
It is knowing
That ignorance and hate
May mourn the dead
It is believing
It is believing
But listen to the
Color of your dreams
It is not living
It is not living
Or play the game
Existence to the end
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning

Shattered and tossed and worn
Too shocking to see

There's a storyteller sleeping alone
He has no face and he has no name
And his whereabouts are sort of unknown
All he needs is his life ln a suitcase
It belongs to a friend of a friend
And as we drink to ourselves
We'll amuse ourselves
Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
So wish me away to an unknown place
Am I living in a land with no name
I'll be making a start with my brand new heart
Stop me making sense once again
All we need is our lives in a suitcase
They belong to a friend of a friend's
And as we drink to ourselves
We'll amuse ourselves
Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again

I hope the tears don't stain
The world that waits outside
And I hope you know
That it won't let go
It sticks around with you
Until the day you die
And I hope you know
That it's touch and go
I hope the tears don't stain
The world that waits outside
Where did it all go wrong?"
Who Feels Love,2006,http://www.metrolyrics.com/who-feels-love-lyrics-oasis.html,1,"Found what I lost inside
My spirit has been purified
Take a thorn from my pride
And hand in hand we'll take a walk outside
Thank you for the sun
The one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years
Between my fantasy and fears
I feel love
Leaving all that I see
Now all my emotions fill the air I breathe
Now you understand that this is not the Promised Land
They spoke of.
There's nothing more to be
If you could be the remedy who heals love
I thank you for the sun
The one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years
Between my fantasy and fears
I feel love
I thank you for the sun
The one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years
Between my fantasy and fears
I feel love"
Who Put the Weight of the World On My Shoulders?,2007,http://www.metrolyrics.com/who-put-the-weight-of-the-world-on-my-shoulders-lyrics-oasis.html,5,"Who put the weight of the world on my shoulders?
Who put the lies in the truth that you sold us?
Lost behind a silver screen
are all the things you could've been to us
So don't try to f**k up my head with your problems
I'm just tryin' to fix up my bed in the doldrums
Lost behind a silver screen
are all the things you could've been in Love and Life soooooo
(Chorus)
Help me out my friend
My head just started to hurt
I don't pretend
I've got all of the time in the world
So now she's gone
all alone in her own universe
I still walk on
'Til I hold you within my world
Help me out my friend
My head just started to hurt
I won't pretend
I've got all of the time in the world
So now she's gone
all alone in her own universe
I still walk on
'Til I hold you within my world
Who put the weight of the world on my shoulders?
Who put the lies in the truth that you sold us?"
Wonderwall,1995,http://www.metrolyrics.com/wonderwall-lyrics-oasis.html,1,"Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Backbeat the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me"

Wont Let You Down,2007,http://www.metrolyrics.com/wont-let-you-down-lyrics-oasis.html,0,"No I won't,
Let you down,
Hate to say you're surrounded by clowns.
Looks to me,
They've had their day,
Think it's time that you came out and played,
Won't you say, it's time that you came out and played,
Won't you say, it's time that you came out and played.
Let's get out of our minds,
Won't waste your time,
Give it a try,
I won't waste your time.
No I won't,
Let you down,
Hate to say you're surrounded by clowns.
Looks to me,
They've had their day,
Think it's time that you came out and played.
Won't you say, It's time that you came out and played,
Won't you say, It's time that you came out and played,
Let's get out of our minds,
Don't waste your time,
Give it a try,
Open your mind.
(BREAK)
Won't let you down,
Don't let me down,
Won't let you down,
I won't let you down."
You've Got To Hide Your Love Away,2007,http://www.metrolyrics.com/youve-got-to-hide-your-love-away-lyrics-oasis.html,0,"Here I stand head in hand, turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on, feelin' two-foot small
Everywhere people stare each and every day
I can see them laugh at me and I hear them say
""Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away""
How could I even try? I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them in the state I'm in
How could she say to me, ""Love will find a way""?
Gather round all you clowns, let me hear you say
""Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away"""

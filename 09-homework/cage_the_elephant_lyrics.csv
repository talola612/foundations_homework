2024,"Fall into that black whole honey
Looking up from your eyes
Everything that you ever wanted
You fight, but why
Folded up just like a piece of paper
Take your sweet little time
You can write it on the sidewalk yea
But your fine, so write
And now you're walking through the door
Just like 2024
Said I gotta believe
Someday you'll see
Someday you'll see that there's something more
Yeah there's something more
That's why you're so bored
Oh there's something more
I never said I'd answer your front door
Never better to be
But I can see you tie your own shoe laces
You bleed
Fall in love just like a new born baby
Blonde hair and blue eyes
Taking pictures with your Polaroid camera
Your fine, it's right
And now you're walking through the door
Just like 2024
Said I gotta believe
Someday you'll see
Someday you'll see that there's something more
Yeah there's something more
That's why your so bored
Oh there's something more
And now you're walking through the door
Just like 2024
Said I gotta believe
Someday you'll see
Someday you'll see that there's something more
Yeah there's something more
That's why you're so bored
Oh there's something more"
Aberdeen,"I've been trying real hard to realize
But some things take a long, long
Long, long time
Long time
Hold the phone, hit repeat
Got me foaming at the knees
Saw the flame, tasted sin
You burned me once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep
Aberdeen
Way back
Way back
Way back
Never saw my dark side in, in your eyes
Back and forth, bloody fingers
Painting up the sky
The sky
Hold the phone, hit repeat
Got me foaming at the knees
Saw the flame, tasted sin
You burned me once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep
Aberdeen
Way back
Way back
Way back
Hold the phone, hit repeat
Got me foaming at the knees
Saw the flame, tasted sin
You burned me once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep
Aberdeen, Aberdeen
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back
Way back"
Aint No Rest For The Wicked,"I was walking down the street
When out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
She said ""I've never seen a man
Who looks so all alone
Could you use a little company?
If you pay the right price
Your evening will be nice
And you can go and send me on my way
I said ""You're such a sweet young thing
Why you do this to yourself?""
She looked at me and this is what she said
""Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay
I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
I know I can't slow down
I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good
Not even fifteen minutes later
I'm still walking down the street
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out of sight
And then he swept up from behind
And put a gun up to my head
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight
He said ""Give me all you've got
I want your money not your life
But if you try to make a move I won't think twice
I told him ""You can have my cash
But first you know I got to ask
What made you want to live this kind of life?""
He said ""There ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay
I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
I know I can't slow down
I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good""
Yeah
(You know it... He was a... You know it... He was a...)
Well now a couple hours passed
And I was sitting at my house
The day was winding down and coming to an end
An' so I turned on the TV
And flipped it over to the news
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend
I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church
He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
But even still I can't say much
Because I know we're all the same
Oh yes, we all seek out to satisfy those thrills
You know there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
We got bills to pay
We got mouths to feed
There ain't nothing in this world for free
I know we can't slow down
We can't hold back
Though you know, we wish we could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good"
Always Something,"Early in the morning
rise to meet the sun
work so hard to feed your wife
no time to show her lovin'
and in the madness of the evening
with diamonds in your hand
came home an hour early
caught her with another man
it's always something
before the late night
around the corner
there's always something waiting for you
can't hold their hands back
can't make the sun rise
it's always something
you know it's always something
on your way back home again
good samaritan
you see a man stuck in the rain
stranded with no friends
and from the goodness of your heart
you save him from the flood
a couple miles down the road
he's covered in your blood
it's always something
before the late night
around the corner
there's always something waiting for you
can't hold their hands back
can't make the sun rise
it's always something
you know it's always something
moving in an' round
you never see it coming
burned by the light
you thought that you were runnin'
blindin again and floating like a feather
why can't you see you can't control the weather
sometimes I cut myself looking in the mirror
with my eyeballs out
and I'm looking at the fear
in the bottom of the dreams
I saw them growing like a plant
but it never works out the way I wrote it in my hands
I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried
it's always something
before the late night
around the corner
there's always something waiting for you
can't hold their hands back
can't make the sun rise
its always something
you know its always something
(you know its always something)
you know its always something"
Around My Head,"Ooooooooh, Ooooooooh
I don't know why I got these feelings, yeah
I just can't seem to get away from
Can you dig it?
You may never see it
No, you will find it falling off my tongue
I take it down town, finally lose it
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a braid, tied-twisted
I don't think it's fair...
Do you-ooooooh?
You-ooooooh?
Are you on the flip side?
You know I took the long way round
Cos all I really am is a homemade elevator
Blinded by your sunshine, put you on a plane to Paris
Lay my cards down on the table
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a braid, tied-twisted
I don't think it's fair...
Can't find a reason for these feelings-
Got enough of them
This guy he told me
Said he's gonna send me something lovely
But even still at times I wonder
What you're thinking of me
You're prob'ly sure I lost my mind
Oh mind, Oh mind, Oh mind, Oh mind
I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a braid, tied-twisted
I don't think it's fair
I don't think it's very polite
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a braid, tied-twisted
I don't think it's fair...
Ahhhhoooooohhh! Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Oh!"
Back Against The Wall,"Tonight I'll have a look
And try to find my face again
Buried beneath this house
My spirit screams and dies again
Out back a monster wears a cloak of Persian leather
Behind the TV screen
I've fallen to my knees
I said you got me where you want me again
And I can't turn away
I'm hanging by thread and I'm feelin' like a ball
I'm stuck here in-between
The shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away
I need to get away
Blanket of silence
Makes me want to sink my teeth in deep
Burn all the evidence
A fabricated disbelief
Pull back the curtains
Took a look into your eyes
My tongue has now become
A platform for your lies
I said you got me where you want me again
And I can't turn away
I'm hanging by thread and I'm feelin' like a ball
I'm stuck here in-between
The shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away
I need to get away
Now you know
Yeah you got my back against the wall
Oh god
I ain't got no other place to hide
Chained down
Like a sittin' duck just waitin' for the fall
You know
Yeah you got my back against the wall
Deep in the jungle
Camouflaged by all the fallen leaves
A hand holds up the sky
While shamefully I make my plea
The alters callin'
But my legs won't seem to stand
Guess I'm a coward
Scared to face the man I am
I said you got me where you want me again
And I can't turn away
I'm hanging by thread and I'm feelin' like a ball
I'm stuck here in-between
The shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away
I need to get away
Now you know
Yeah you got my back against the wall
Oh god
I ain't got no other place to hide
Chained down
Like a sittin' duck just waitin' for the fall
You know
Yeah you got my back against the wall
Now you know
Yeah you got my back against the wall
Oh god
I ain't got no other place to hide
Chained down
Like a sittin' duck just waitin' for the fall
You know
Yeah you got my back against the wall"
Back Stabbin' Betty,"Poor guy that man John Thomas
His woman truly was a devil
And she wasn't all that honest
She tore him down on every level
You're a no good lazy motherfucker
Got a, a shit job you worthless motherfucker
You're a, a dead beat feel sorry for your mother
If I had time I'd trade you for another
He don't like that
He wants his life back
He wants to go back home
He tried so hard to please her
He sold his soul to keep her happy
But nothin' he did impressed her
She always left him feelin' shitty
This is it? No, this can't be all you bought me
Said I'm, I'm high class and this is where you brought me
Gonna strike low just like my momma taught me
You're a, a low life you're lucky that you got me
He don't like that
He wants his life back
He wants to go back home
Down deep way down inside him
The will to leave was growing stronger
And he bit his tongue for so long
He couldn't hold back any longer
You're a two faced ruthless instigator
You're a, a low down triflin' masquerader
You're a, a cold bitch controllin' conversator
This is too much I'm out I'll see you later
She don't like that
But he got his life back
No she don't like that
But he's right back on track
I said he went back home"
Black Madonna,
Broken Boy,
Cigarette Daydreams,"Did you stand there all alone?
Oh I cannot explain what's going down
I can see you standing next to me
In and out somewhere else right now
You sigh look away
I can see it clear as day
Close your eyes so afraid
Hide behind that baby face
Do do do do do do
You can drive all night
Looking for answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer
Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all I followed you into the hall
Cigarette daydream
You were only seventeen
So sweet with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees
Do do do do do do
You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer
If we could find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you could find a reason, a reason to say
Standing in the pouring rain
Do do do do do do...
You can drive all night
Looking for answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer
If we could find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you could find a reason, a reason to say
Standing in the pouring rain"
Cold Cold Cold,"Doctor look into my eyes
I've been breathing air but there's no sign of life
Doctor the problem's in my chest
My heart feels cold as ice but it's anybody's guess
Doctor can you help me cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind
Doctor can you help me cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind
Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Darker in the day than the dead of night
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Doctor can you help me cause something don't feel right
Something don't feel right
Sweet nurse don't look at me that way
I've seen those eyes before I can tell you want to play
Counselor give me some advice
Tell me how hard will I fall if I live a double life
Doctor can you help me cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind
Doctor can you help me cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast because there ain't much time
Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Darker in the day than the dead of night
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Doctor can you help me cause something don't feel right
Something don't feel right
Something just ain't right
And as the darkness falls it fills up both my eyes
My life before me like a flash in the night
With my arms open wide
Well it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Doctor can you help me cause something don't feel right
Something don't feel right
Something just ain't right"
Come A Little Closer,"Time shakes, found you at the water
At first you were my father, now I love you like a brother
Earthquakes shake the dust behind you
This world at times will blind you
Still I know I'll see you there
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Things aren't always what they seem to be
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been seeing
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been dreaming
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Heartbreaks, the heavy world's upon your shoulders
Will we burn or we just smolder
Somehow I know I'll find you there
Oooh, I wanna see if you can change it, change it
Still I know I'll see you there
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Things aren't always what they seem to be
Do you understand the things that you've been seeing
Come on, come on, come on
Do you understand the things that you've been dreaming
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh...
Ten thousand people stand alone now
And in the evening the sun sets
Tomorrow it will rise
Time flies by, they all sang along
Time flies by, they all sang along
Time flies by, they all sang along
Time flies by by...
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come on, come on, come on
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see
Come a little closer, then you'll see"
Cry Baby,"I think it's pretty strange
Watching the passersby
Crawling all over one another
Trying to get ahead in life
Monday you cough
Tuesday you cry
Wednesday in bed
What if you die?
You say that I'm insane
I say you're probably right
We all got something important to say
But talking's a waste of time
Monday you cough
Tuesday you cry
Wednesday in bed
What if you die?
Cry baby cry
Kick, scream, fight
Hold on with all your might
You're gonna die, die
Open up your eyes or life will pass you by
Don't you think it's pretty strange?
All got something to hide
House in the desert, top of a mountain
Lost in a deep-sea dive
Monday you cough
Tuesday you cry
Wednesday in bed
Thursday you die
Cry baby cry
Kick, scream, fight
Hold on with all your might
You're gonna die, die
Open up your eyes or life will pass you by
Without love
Without love
Nothing else will ever be enough
Cry baby cry
Like it or not
Like it or not
It's a matter of time
Cry baby cry
Like it or not
Like it or not
It's a matter of time"
Dance Dance,
Dr. Dr. Dr.,"I went in as a patient,
They kept me constantly waiting.
I gave my best performance,
They knew that I was faking.
Hey, I ain't got much else to say,
No excuses I can make.
Fuzzy feeling on the wall,
Lord y'know I tried 'em all.
Now watch me rise and, and fall.
So warm wrapped in a blanket,
Feel wholesome, almost naked
I watch my fingers tremble,
No sign of hesitation.
Hey, I ain't got much else to say,
No excuses I can make.
Fuzzy feeling on the wall,
Lord y'know I tried 'em all.
Now watch me rise and, and fall, and fall.
Aint got no problem do you,
Aint got no problem said OH OH OH NO.
Aint got no problem do you,
Aint got no problem said OH OH OH NO.
Hey, I ain't got much else to say,
No excuses I can make.
Fuzzy feeling on the wall,
Lord y'know I tried 'em all.
Lord y' know I tried 'em all.
Lord y'know I tried 'em all.
Lord y'know I tried 'em all.
Lord y'know I tried 'em."
Drones In The Valley,"While bullets shower the Earth
We turn our heads and cover our faces
Now flames devour the sky
And I hear these words in the back of my mind
Here we stand at this fork in the road
We got no time to waste
Oh, which way shall we go?
This whole world's spinnin' out of control
Oh, which way shall we go?
Which way shall we go?
I can't believe this, it makes me sick
Fresh smell of death on your tongue
You bait the hook and here come the children
Another gravestone to sell
While you get rich in the valley of Hell
Here we stand at this fork in the road
We got no time to waste
Oh, which way shall we go?
This whole world's spinnin' out of control
Oh, which way shall we go?
Which way shall we go?
I can't believe this, it makes me - sick
The devil's creepin' he's got us eatin' from his dirty hands
We feast on lies which makes it hard for us to take a stand
Out in the desert there's a forest full of fallen trees
It's what they want but, no it's not what we need
Screamin' at the ceilin' doesn't make it better
Slipped into a coma, lost my favorite sweater
Ask them no more questions, you'll never catch them lyin'
It's time to make our move and strike them right between the eyes
Here we stand at this fork in the road
We got no time to waste
Oh, which way shall we go?
This whole world's spinnin' out of control
Oh, which way shall we go?
Which way shall we go?"
Flow,"Looking out my window
Wonder how it came to be
Feels just like a tempo
Lifted by a gentle breeze
Ugly as a suitcase
I can see it stretch for days
Hanging on a sunset
Softly trampled by the rain
Way too long
Hold on
Hold on
Dead and gone
So long
Hold on
Way too long
Hold on
Hold on
Dead and gone
So long
Hold on
So long
Hold on
Looking out my window
Trying to find a hiding place
Climb up to the tree tops
Watch it all just drift away
Way too long
Hold on
Hold on
Dead and gone
So long
Hold on
Way too long
Hold on
Hold on
Dead and gone
So long
Hold on
So long
Hold on
Timber shakes these trails; they all derail
Phony, false, and frail
An empty ocean lost our way with no direction home
Golden needles, names we take in vain
Find it harder to remain
And nothing's sacred still waiting on that explanation
Right before my eyes
I saw the whole world lose control
The whole world lost control
Before my eyes uh-huh
I fell through the floor
I couldn't take this anymore
I can't take this anymore
It breaks my mind uh-huh
Holding dirty hands over the flames
Getting pleasure from the pain
Softly screaming the pistol that you raised has spoken
Golden needles names we take in vain
Find it harder to remain
Well nothing's sacred still waiting on that explanation
Right before my eyes
I saw the whole world lose control
The whole world lost control
Before my eyes uh-huh
I fell through the floor
I couldn't take this anymore
I can't take this anymore
It breaks my mind uh-huh
Everything I thought I knew fell to the side
Time went on and on I couldn't see past my own eyes
Past my eyes
Past my eyes
Past my eyes
Right before my eyes
I saw the whole world lose control
The whole world lost control
Before my eyes uh-huh
I fell through the floor
I couldn't take this anymore
I can't take this anymore
It breaks my mind uh-huh"
Free Love,"Yeah
Oh, yeah
A-come on, girl
Hey
She move so quick, she move so fast
She move so quick she make the good times last
She said that even in the mornin' said you know it's on
Even in the mornin'
Free love (Free love)
Free love (Free love, love, love) Love
She like it rough, she bendin' bones
She starts a screamin' when she's ready to go
She said that even in the mornin' said you know that it's on
Even in the mornin'
Free love (Free love)
Free love (Free love, love, love) Love
Pretty girl come with me
Two on two, three on three
Passion is the flavor climbin' up this tree
Make a fuss, move around
Keep it on the underground
Just beneath the covers I can see the sea
She knocking knees, so full of pride
She made the move 'cause she's got nothin' to hide
She said that even in the mornin' said you know that it's on
Even in the mornin'
Free love (Free love)
Free love (Free love, love, love) Love

Free love (Free love)
Free love (Free love)
Free love (Free love)
Free love, love, love, love, love, love, love-love, love"
Golden Brown,"Golden brown, texture like sun
Lays me down, with my mind she runs
Throughout the night, no need to fight
Never a frown with golden brown
Every time, just like the last
On her ship tied to the mast
To distant lands, takes both my hands
Never a frown with golden brown
Golden brown, finer temptress
Through the ages, she's heading west
From far away, stays for a day
Never a frown with golden brown
Never, never a, never a frown with golden, with golden brown
Never, never a frown with golden, with golden brown
Never, never a frown with golden, with golden brown
Never, never a frown with golden, with golden brown"
Goodbye,"[Verse 1]
All my life, I read between the lines
Held on too tight, you know I tried
But in the end, it left me paralyzed
It's alright, goodbye, goodbye
Seems like yesterday I was a child
Just a ripple in the folds of time
I wish you well, I want to see you smile
It's alright, goodbye
Goodbye
[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I won't cry, I won't cry, I won't cry
Lord knows how hard we tried
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
[Verse 2]
So many things I want to say to you
So many sleepless nights I prayed for you
My heart's an ashtray and I lost my mind
You bring the smokes, I've got the time
I want to scream, I want to laugh, I want to close my eyes
I want to hide somewhere that's hard to find
Stop wasting time trying to shape your life
It's alright, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I won't cry, I won't cry, I won't cry
Lord knows how hard we tried
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
[Bridge]
My pretty bird, my favorite lullaby
How'd I become the thorn in your side?
All your laughter turned into a cry
It's alright, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I won't cry, I won't cry, I won't cry
Lord knows how hard we tried
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye"
Halo,"Every time I get away you
Find a way to reel me back in (oh)
Tell me that you love me
Hold me tight so we can always be friends (oh)
I swear
I've said it before and I'll say it again! (oh)
Every time I get away you
Find a way to pull me back in (oh)
Why does it take so long?
Why does it feel so wrong?
Why does it take so loong?
Knew I couldn't help myself
I had to lay low
So I couldn't help myself
I lost my halo
Take me by the hand and
Still remember all the good times we had (oh)
I remember how you took my favorite knife
And sticked under my skin (oh)
I swear
I've said it before, and I say it again! (oh)
Every time I get away you
Find a way back under my skin
Why does it take so long?
Why does it feel so wrong?
Knew I couldn't help myself
I had to lay low
So I couldn't help myself
I lost my halo
All my life
With a skeleton
I had to let go
So I couldn't help myself
I lost my halo
I lost my halo
I lost my halo"
House of Glass,
How Are You True,"Wake up, say a little prayer
Out of bed to the bathroom where
I take a look at myself and I stop and stare
And I wonder who is this standing here
And I try to find the will to carry on
Wonder how much longer I can carry on
Cause these days they take so long, yes they do
Hey, how are you true?
The light will guide you home, yes it will
Hey, how are you true?
Well there's one thing that you should know
Yes you should
You need love, you need love, you need love
You need love
All your days spend countin' numbers
'Til one day you'll find, day you'll find
That life has passed you by
And in the quiet still of silence try to hide your eyes
Oh no so don't cry, oh no
Hey, how are you true?
The light will guide you home, yes it will
Oh the years, they turn so fast
Soon the present will be past and you'll look back and laugh
Yes you will
Well I can still remember, yes I was a young man too
Alone, but not forgotten and the candle shining through
Still all these words I've spoken don't mean anything at all
Without love, without love, without love
Without love
Do, do, do, oh yeah
Do, do, do, oh yeah
I remember clearly we were both there on the airplane
Told me all your secrets, oh I never saw it coming
I thought that you were joking
You were actually quite serious"
In One Ear,"They say that we ain't got the style
We ain't got the class
We ain't got the tunes that's
Gonna put us on the map
And I'm a phony in disguise
Tryin' to make the radio
I'm an anti-social anarchist
I sound like so and so
They say I'm just a stupid kid
Another crazy radical
Rock'n'roll is dead
I probably should have stayed in school
Another generation X
Who somehow slipped up through the cracks
Oh they'd love to see me fall
But I'm already on my back
So it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand
Now I know I'm not a saint
I've been a sinner all my life
I ain't tryin' to hide my flaws
I'd rather keep them in the light
They want to criticize, scrutinize
Cast another stone
Burn me at the stake
And sit and watch it from their throne
They say the devil is my pal
I do a lot of drugs
The crowd will only like me
If they're really fuckin' drunk
They think they know my thoughts
But they don't know the least
If they'd listen to the words
They'd find a message tucked beneath
But it goes in one ear, and right out the other,
People talkin' shit, even though they never bother,
It goes in one ear, and right out the other,
People talkin' shit, they can kiss the back of my hand!
You hear that?
You hear what's coming?
Oh, you better run for the hills
'Cause we're coming to your town
And we're gonna burn that motherfucker down
Here's the moral to the story
We don't do it for the glory
We don't do it for the money
We don't do it for the fame
So all the critics who despise us
Go ahead and criticize us
It's your tyranny that drives us
Adds the fire to our flames
And it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit so you know we never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
I'm only playing music 'cause you know I fucking love it
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand"
Indy Kidz,"I want to be just like you
I've got these pictures keep on rolling 'round my head
I want to hang them on the wall above my bed
And it's so easy to step aside
And walk in line like all the rest
I never did well on tests
I don't watch TV cause it's just a box of lies
It makes me want to stick a toothpick in my mind
While the world goes down the drain
I eat my popcorn from the bag
Some people say that I've gone M-m-mad
(Talking)
I got-I gotta get down to the school house
And get some
A-A-And get some shoes
And-And get the right haircut
Get the right haircut!
You're so cool
I wanna be just like you
You're so cool"
Instant Crush,"I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take
One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don't believe in himâhis lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the ""Roche""
But no one gives us any time anymore
He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said
I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine
I didn't want to anymore, oh, oh, oh
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again
It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissor at the seem in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore
I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine
I didn't want to anymore, oh, oh, oh
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
I don't understand, don't get upset
I'm not with you
We're swimming around
It's all I do, when I'm with you
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day

Give me your heart like a hole in the head

James Brown,"Run around the corner
Fell asleep in the sun
You had to move into the shade
Before you fire the gun
We got a hunger for destruction
Need someone to bleed
You sealed the deal before the dawn
You let your actions proceed
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Sooner or later said you know that it's true
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
You think you're so sly
You tried to roll by
You played the safe side
You said will somebody take me
Down town
Another James Brown
You made the same sound
You said will somebody write this down .... down
Fightin' back revenge
You've got you're face to the ground
You make excuses for the madness
You've been hanging around
You built a house up in the trees
So you could see everyone
You set the clock and had a run
You set the clock and had a run
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Sooner or later said you know that it's true
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
You think you're so sly
You tried to roll by
You played the safe side
You said will somebody take me
Down town
Another James Brown
You made the same sound
You said will somebody write this down... down

Japanese Buffalo,"[Spoken:] One two three four five six

Alright

How many more times you cross the line
Run for days with eager eyes
Screaming smile left alone

In the forest of your mind
Haunted by the loss of time
Feet stuck frozen in the snow
These crazy things you do

Run it over my skin like a cheap plastic knife
In your heart and in your mind put me
Always aside
Do it over and again till it cuts to the bone
We can play by the rules or just
Leave it alone
It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame
That your heart has turned to stone
Now your heart's turned to stone
Run it over my skin like a cheap plastic knife
In your heart and in your mind
Put me always aside
Do it over and again till it cuts to the bone
We can play by the rules

Judas,"The time has finally come you get a mouth full
You only act on greed and by your actions this is proof
And can't you see the flowers dying all around you
Got your hands in the devils pockets
Got everything to lose
And so you lash out
To crush the ones below
Cuz they are the ones that you fear most
And you call this crowd control well let me break it down for you
The fire in your veins
is just a joke you tell yourself
Another way to cut the cost
To hide your face from all the guilt
And it's a shame to have to say
You had to kill to gain control again
But at least you made some money
Hey, let the good times roll
And it's your dream to be the king of all creation
As far as I'm concerned you've hung your shadow on the wall
And though your fingers never really pulled the trigger
Your hands are just as guilty, you're the one who bought the blood
Again you lash out
To hush the ones who know
Cuz they are the ones that you fear most
And it's called crowd control
Well let me break it down for you
Oh my the greed has now consumed you
Your eyes fade as you fall into the ocean
You move fast to feed your lust for money
You dive down now your caught in the commotion
All this and you trade it in for nothing
A cheap lie you put it in your pocket
All this and you trade it in for nothing
Oh my I can see your heart has met it's end
Say hello to Judas"
Lotus,"Woke before the morning sun
I found it tucked beneath the hills
I sat and watched it rise
It hit the sky and burst to flames
The lotus flower's
Got me thinkin' 'bout the way that we live
I've got this feelin'
It's gonna stop
Driven by religion
Running backwards down a one way road
A course collision, split decision
Tryin' to save your soul
Manifest Destiny
Is just a fancy word for murder
I've got this feelin'
It's gonna stop
A billion faces runnin' round my head
All got opinions but they don't mean shit
Keep droppin' bombs until the whole world's dead
They said it's all been done and it's all been said
They'll turn this message into a pop movement
A fashion statement, call it politics
You can mark my words, they'll put a spin on it
They say it's all been done
Look outside the box my friend
Your heart's been dead since who knows when
It seems we've missed the mark
Lost all hope and given in
Pack up the suitcase
Take that handkerchief and wipe off your chin
The fear that drives you
Needs to be stopped
Fell into a daze
And found my mind was gone and laid to waste
A battleground indeed
Where holy wars have taken place
I saw the sunset watched it travel down
And tear through the ground
The hate that drives us
Needs to be stopped"

Night Running,"We're on a night run
Boy you better hold your tongue
Talking like you coming from kingdom come
Rhythm and reeling
The feeling I'm riding
The sound to the ceiling
Never got no money
But I'm running from the gun
My engines flooded
Cold blooded no money
Drunk on something uh
Killing the moonlight
With daylight
Got my x ray eyes
And I'm feeling so fine
Night Running all night running
Star studded not far from it
We're running all night running
Cold blooded all night running
Night running all night running
Star studded not far from it
Night running all night running
Cold blooded we're all night running
We're on the night shade
Tell me what we're hiding from
Like someone could steal it
Are we waiting for some kind of feeling
Or saving it up for the morning?
Under cover
The cloak and dagger
Is there a creature in the attic
Are we for real yeah
Or just pretending
Will it burn it out by the morning
Night Running all night running
Star studded not far from it
We're running all night running
Cold blooded all night running
Night running all night running
Star studded not far from it
Night running all night running
Cold blooded we're all night running
We're on a night run
No telling who we're running from
In a world of secrets and demons and people hiding from the sun
Sending my message to everyone losing control
Better not stop 'till I get home
Sentimental flowers don't grow
Got to live through tidal waves
And parishes and biblical floods
I got the Gris Gris love
And the streets in my blood
I'm on the final run
Falling in and out of love
Night Running all night running
Star studded not far from it
We're running all night running
Cold blooded all night running
Night running all night running
Star studded not far from it
Night running all night running
Cold blooded we're all night running"

Ready to Let Go,"Sun went down, sun went down over Pompeii
On both sides the vow was broken
Oh my my, I'm the one
Trying to hide this damage done
One day, all our secrets will be spoken
As we slow dance, I became your statue, frozen
'Times I wonder, are we just a puff of smoke? Yeah
Underneath this bed of ashes
Still withholding everything
Like we were never close
Don't you worry baby
No sense trying to change it
I'ma strike these matches
Never had control
I'm ready to let go
No, was I fooling myself
I'ma spread these ashes
Never had control
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready to let go
Sun went down, sun went down over Pompeii
On holy ground, our vows were broken
We met up
We broke bread
I was blue, your dress was red, ain't it strange?
We both knew this day was coming
As we slow dance, I became your statue, frozen
'Times I wonder, are we just a puff of smoke? yeah
Underneath this bed of ashes, still withholding everything

Right Before My Dreams,
Right Before My Eyes,"Timber shakes these trails, they are derailed
Phony, false and frail
An empty ocean
Lost our way with no direction home
Gonna need those, names we take in vain
Find it harder to remain
No nothing sacred
Still waiting on that explanation
Right before my eyes
I saw the whole world lose control
The whole world lost control
Before my eyes
I fell through the floor
I couldn't take it anymore
I can't take this anymore
It breaks my mind
Hold her dirty hands over the flames
Getting pleasure from the pain
Softly screaming
The pistol that she raised has spoken
Golden needles, names we take in vain
Find it harder to remain
Nothing sacred
Still waiting on that explanation
Right before my eyes
I saw the whole world lose control
The whole world lost control

Rubber Ball,"Rolling around like a big rubber ball
Writing this song about some things that I saw
Trying to stand like a big strong tough man
Finding out fast that I'm sinking in sand
All I got is nothing but a little bit of love
Gonna give it to the people then they'll see
Then they'll see
Spinning the tops as the tables they turn
Made some mistakes but I still couldn't learn
Covered my tracks, thought I was fine
Got no self control now I'm back here in line
All I got is nothing but a little bit of love
Gonna give it to the people then they'll see
Then they'll see
All I got is nothing but a little bit of love
Gonna give it to the people then they'll see
Then they'll see"

Runaway runaway runaway from the beast

Sell Yourself,"Well, I tried to paint my mind
But now I'm stuck here in the middle

Got my tongue all tied in knots
On my forehead placed a label
Took all my inspiration
Carved your name into the table
Let's talk about me,
Let's talk about you,
I know your type
I know exactly what you wanna do
And if the money's right
You think I'd disagree
So sad to see you torn apart
By Hell and selfish greed
And sell yourself
Don't be a fool
Sell yourself
They need your body
Sell yourself
Don't be a fool
Sell yourself
Sell yourself
All my memory shard becomes dirty little pieces
Choking on your cancer, waitin' on to new releases
No more need to operate
You are ready for the masses
Nothing more to give you
You are ready for the masses

Let's talk about you,
I know your type
I know exactly what you wanna do

Shake Me Down,"Shake me down
Not a lot of people left around
Who knows now
Softly laying on the ground, ooooh
Not a lot people left around, ooooh. ooooh
In my life, I have seen
People walk into the sea
Just to find memories
Plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down
Fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
Shake me down
Cut my hair on a silver cloud
Broken sound
Softly laying on the ground, ooooh
Not a lot people left around, ooooh, ooooh
In my past, bittersweet
There's no love between the sheets
Taste the blood, broken dreams
Lonely times indeed
With eyes cast down
Fixed upon the ground
Eyes cast down
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
Turn back now its time for me to let go
Way down had to find a place to lay low
Lampshade turned around into a light post
Walk around the corner
Never saw it coming still
I try to make a move
It almost stopped me from belief
I don't wanna know the future
But I'm like rolling thunder
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the-
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the-
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
Shake me down
Not a lot of people left around, ooooh, ooooh"

Skin and Bones,
Social Cues,
Soil To The Sun,"In the depths of my mind I laid sleepin'
Well, I had such a dream when I woke I was weepin'
The vision I saw danced around me
And my heart saw the things that my eyes couldn't see
Oh, the sun crashed down to the ground
The moon rose up to the sky, blood-red
All the dead climbed up out from their graves
They fell to their knees as the stars started screamin'
Come one - come all - come see it, believe it
The truth - will shine if you open you eyes
And you'll see - it move as it moves on the masses
The weak - will rise and give birth to the sky
... the sky
No, it didn't stop there, it consumed me
And it crushed me with joy as it's beauty swept through me
I was moved by the weight of it all
I'd been touched by the light, yes I know what I saw
Oh, the sun crashed down to the ground
The moon rose up to the sky, blood-red
All the dead climbed up out from their graves
They fell to their knees as the stars started screamin'
Come one - come all - come see it, believe it
The truth - will shine if you open you eyes
And you'll see - it move as it moves on the masses
The weak - will rise and give birth to the sky
... the sky
Ha, ha, ha
I saw the demons dreamin'
I heard people singin'
The dinosaurs are dyin'
The mind control's subsidin'
I saw a new path beatin'
Free thinkers freely thinkin'
Can't stop a thought from breathin'
It moves like fire
The sun crashed down to the ground
The moon rose up to the sky, blood-red
All the dead climbed up out from their graves
They fell to their knees as the stars started screamin'
Come one - come all - come see it, believe it
The truth - will shine if you open you eyes
And you'll see - it move as it moves on the masses
The weak - will rise and give birth to the sky
... the sky"
Spdierhead,"I am the one you left for dead
(Say you wanted to)
You are the bullet in my head
(Ahh)
And as you stand over my grave
(Tell me it's okay)
You'll pause the lips upon my face.
(Ahh)
Either I'm in heaven, or I'm in hell
Am I losing my mind, yeah
(Cause I can't tell)
I've been waiting for answers for way too long
Seems I'm always waiting around.
Spiders in my head, spiders in my mind
You may take my eyes, but baby I'm not blind
It all works out in time
You know I'm gonna be all right
You may take my eyes, but baby I'm not blind.
I think your mother wants me dead
(Say you wanted to)
I am a schizophrenic man
(Ahh)
I wouldn't change you if I could
(Say you wanted to)
Treat me good I'll play it cool.
Spiders in my head, spiders in my mind
You may take my eyes, but baby I'm not blind
It all works out in time
You know I'm gonna be all right
You may take my eyes, but baby I'm not blind.
Spiders in my head, spiders in my mind
You may take my eyes, but baby I'm not blind
It all works out in time
You know I'm gonna be all right
You may take my eyes, but baby I'm not blind."
Sweetie Little Jean,"sweetie little Jean where did you go?
everyone's been searching high and low
and your mother's worried sick
dearest daddy lost his grip
while the whole world's watching
candlelight vigils being held in silence on the channel four
and they've knocked on every door
every place you've been before
how long will we let it go?
i think we should just let go
i, i want you babe
let's get back
lay my weary head against your bones
where all my troubles will be dead and gone
how long will we let it go?
i think we should just let go
has melancholy taken you for good?
you know that i would save you if i could
watched your laughter turn to tears
then you vanished in thin air
well we pinned your missing persons picture up on every mother-lovin' post
how's it feel to be a ghost?
you're the one I love the most
i, i want you babe
let's get back
lay my weary head against your breast
where all my troubles will be laid to rest
i pushed and i pulled 'til i pushed you aside
now all that is left are the tears that you cried
i'm sorry love for all of the damage done
i only hope
that someday to be back beside you
i, i want you babe
let's get back
lay my weary head against your bones
where all our troubles will be dead and gone
how long will we let it go?
i think we should just let go"
Take It Or Leave It,"Baby you should know by now that I'm right, for you.
But every time I step to you, you change your tune.
Sweet wheel of death keeps us holding our breathe.
I step to the right, you move to the left.
Unless no one else.
I'd rather die to myself.
Oh why, won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess.
I'm starting to unwind.
I been tripping over you.
So tell me something new.
Take it or leave it.
Maybe I should pack my things and move on?
Maybe I'm fooling myself and youre already gone?
Watching the flames wither and fade.
Trying to make sense of the look on your face.
I'm down, I'm an itch.
Just playing that I can hold on.
Oh why, won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess.
I'm learning to unwind.
I've been tripping over you.
So tell me something new.
Take it or leave it.
Baby please.
Oh baby please.
Stay with me or cut me free.
Its all of me.
Oh why, wont you make up your mind?
I think I must confess.
I'm starting to unwind.
I been tripping over you.
So tell me something new.
Take it or leave it.
Take it or leave it"
Tangle,"""Around My Head""
Ooooooooh, Ooooooooh
I don't know why I got these feelings, yeah,
I just can't seem to get away from
Can you dig it?
You may never see it
No, you will find it falling off my tongue
I take it down town, finally lose it
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a braid, tied-twisted
I don't think it's fair...
Do you-ooooooh?
You-ooooooh?
Are you on the flip side?
You know I took the long way round
Cos all I really am is a homemade elevator
Blinded by your sunshine, put you on a plane to Paris
Lay my cards down on the table
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a braid, tied-twisted
I don't think it's fair...
Can't find a reason for these feelings-
Got enough of them
This guy he told me,
Said he's gonna send me something lovely
But even still at times I wonder
What you're thinking of me
You're prob'ly sure I lost my mind,
Oh mind, Oh mind, Oh mind, Oh mind
I don't think it's very nice
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a braid, tied-twisted
I don't think it's fair
I don't think it's very polite
To walk around my head all night
You got me tangled like a braid, tied-twisted
I don't think it's fair...
Ahhhhoooooohhh!
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Oh"
Telescope,"In a far and distant galaxy
Inside my telescope I see
A pair of eyes look back at me
He walks and talks and looks like me
Sits around inside his house
From room to room he moves about
Fills his life with pointless things
and wonders how it all turns out.
Safe to say that
I don't think you understand!
There's nowhere left to turn
Walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent
or time I've wasted.
Don't waste it.
Afraid of what the truth might bring
He locks his doors and never leaves
Desperately searching for signs
to terrify, to find a thing
He battens all the hatches down
and wonders why he hears no sound
Frantically searching his dreams
he wonders what it's all about
Safe to say that
I don't think you understand!
There's nowhere left to turn
These walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent
or time I've wasted...
Clearing my mind,
losing my friends
Fall on my face
do it again.
You say how, do, you do.
Man, how 'bout you?
Man, how 'bout you?
To be sold
To be killed
To be so
In my head, I'm alone
Just like you, I've been tryin'
To be scared
In my bones, I feel cold.
I give thanks to the lord in this tree
In this street
Let me be, I don't need
To be here, I'm alone
I don't think you understand!
There's nowhere left to turn
These walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent
or time I've wasted...
Don't waste it."
That's Right,"Let your hair down, let's unwind
Take your problems, leave them behind
You got your troubles and I got mine
Baby that's right, baby that's right
I get in trouble cause I speak my mind
Sometimes I like it when I make you cry
Baby that's right, baby that's right
I know tomorrow we may have regrets
But as for right now where's the party at?
We'll stay up all night waiting for the sun to shine, sun to shine
Baby that's right, baby that's right, baby that's right, ahh
Take a bottle of whiskey and a bottle of wine
Take all your problems, leave them far behind
I say I'm sorry almost every time
Baby that's right, baby that's right
I know tomorrow we may have regrets
But as for right now where's the party at?
We'll stay up all night waiting for the sun to shine, sun to shine
Baby that's right, baby that's right, baby that's right
Wait 'til tomorrow then we can reflect
But as for right now where's the party at?
We'll stay up all night waiting for the sun to shine, sun to shine
Baby that's right, baby that's right, baby that's right
Ahh, ahh, ooh, ooh

The War Is Over,
Tiny Little Robots,"They've got you movin' to the city
Oh my, you think you're lookin' pretty
But they've got their pistols too
Tucked down beneath their shoe
It's a new sensation
World annihilation
Moving to the music
Patiently it's waitin'
The city's screamin'
I can hear them breathin'
Cryin' out for wisdom
Hungry minds are feedin'
And I know that you're tired of this
'Cause you're a robot
They designed your life
But true souls said you know what's right
And you can join us on the other side
Are you scared?
Are you scared?
Are you scared?
They've got you marching to a drum beat
Oh, my, you got another nose bleed
They'll keep you so amused
You'll never taste the truth
It's a new creation
Total domination
Chains across your shoulders
Social captivation
Kill our leaders
Persecute our teachers
Criticize our culture
Crucify free thinkers
I know that you're tired of this
'Cause you're a robot
They designed your life
But true souls said you know what's right
And you can join us on the other side
Are you scared?
Are you scared?
Are you scared?
Fill our eyes with money
Vanity that's cunnin'
Only on the surface
Diamonds look so stunnin'
Mass deception
Altered our perception
Sold it to the children
Made a new connection
And I know that you're tired of this
'Cause you're a robot
They designed your life
But true souls said you know what's right
And you can join us on the other side
(Our sideways are broken, Our minds have been twisted. The billboards are lying; the line has been made. The
streets are all empty, we paved them with zombies. A lost generation, generically
made. Amidst all the madness I saw a flower. A dream that was creepin' I kept in my
sight and then it turned and it took me - an explosion, it sme. Beauty that screams
""I'm alive."")"
Tokyo Smoke,
Too Late to Say Goodbye,"Oh, my precious ember burning,
My sweet glowing light.
From the moment I first saw you,
I was yours and you were mine.
Deep down we both knew
You were trouble by design
And the echo of my mother's words
""Baby don't you play with fire""
I was always playing the part
First love
Only set by a spark
There was
No way of changing my mind
Now I'm under your spell
Trapped in a lie
Shouldn't have stood that close to the fire
No turning back
No where to run
No where to hide
It's too late to say goodbye
Push back from my heart, wish we go back to the start
But oh my God is this real
No more time
It's too late
It's too late to say goodbye.
I can hear the sounds of sirens circling around
Forced to watch the ashes floating softly drifting to the ground
Deep down we both knew it was trouble by design
And the echo of my mother's words
""Baby don't you play with fire""
I was always playing the part
First love
Only set by a spark
There was
No way changing my mind
Now I'm under your spell
Trapped in a lie
Shouldn't have stood that close to the fire
No turning back
No where to run
No where to hide
It's too late to say goodbye
Push back from my heart, wish we go back to The start
But oh my God is this real
No more time
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late to say goodbye
After all the dust has settled we can settle down
Just the two of us forever no one else around
No one else around
Around
Now I'm under your spell
Trapped in a lie
Shouldn't have stood that close to the fire
No turning back
No where to run
No where to hide
It's too late to say goodbye
Push back from my heart, wish we go back to the start
But oh my God no where to escape
No more time
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late to say goodbye."
Trouble,"Ooo-ooh
We were at the table by the window in the view
Casting shadows, the sun was pushing through
Spoke a lot of words, I don't know if I spoke the truth
Got so much to lose
Got so much to prove
God don't let me lose my mind
Trouble on my left, trouble on my right
I've been facing trouble almost all my life
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look I catch a glimpse of you
I said it was love and I did it for life
Did-did it for you
Ooo-ooh
We will come to pass, will I pass the test?
You know what they say, yeah
The wicked get no rest
You can have my heart, any place, any time
Got so much to lose
Got so much to prove
God don't let me lose my mind
Trouble on my left, trouble on my right
I've been facing trouble almost all my life
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look I catch a glimpse of you
I said it was love and I did it for life
Did-did it for you
Trouble on my left, trouble on my right
I've been facing trouble almost all my life
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look I catch a glimpse of you
I said it was love and I did it for life
Did-did it for you
Ooo-ooh
Got so much to lose
Got so much to prove
God don't let me lose my mind"
What I'm Becoming,
Whole Wide World,"When I was a young boy
My mama said to me
""There's only one girl in the world for you
And she probably lives in Tahiti""
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
Or maybe she's in the Bahamas
Where the Caribbean Sea is blue
Weeping in a tropical moonlit night
Because nobody's talking about you
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
Why am I hanging around in the rain out here
Trying to pick up a girl
Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
When there's girls all over the world
Is she lying on some tropical beach somewhere
Underneath a tropical sun
Pining a way in a heat wave there
Hoping that I won't be long
I should be lying on that sun-soaked beach with her
Caressing her warm, brown skin
And then in a year or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
Hey!"
